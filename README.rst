From Dead Zero
==============

I've stumbled upon a unique opportunity.  

We have started a very complicated open source development project.
We hope to build a toolset for building and debugging complex
network layouts in AWS from the perspective of an experienced Cisco network
adminitrator.  We expect to make use of Docker, Cisco, Python, SQL, AWS CDK,
and dozens of AWS services.

One of our team has no previous experience with computing beyond basic
Windows usage.  Yet they bring to the table a genuine desire to learn.

It has been so long for me.  I have forgotten how difficult it is to get
started.  Everything seems to depend on everything else.  How do we mentor
a gifted student who is starting from dead zero?

This is our journey!
